#  Pandas Series â€“ Test Pass Rate %
# Create a Python script named pandas_series_passrate.py that:
# Creates a Series for test pass percentage across 5 builds:
# [80, 85, 78, 90, 88]
# with labels: ['B1','B2','B3','B4','B5']
# Prints the Series.
# Calculates and prints the average pass rate.
# Finds which build had the highest pass rate.
# Uses iloc to print pass rate of the last build.
# Uses loc to print pass rate of Build B3.
# Normalizes values by subtracting average from each pass rate.
